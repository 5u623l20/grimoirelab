# GrimoireLab

This is for stuff relevant to GrimoireLab as a whole. For example:

* Issues for new features or bug reports that affect more than one GrimoireLab module. In this case, let's open an issue here, and when implementing the fix or the feature, letÂ´s comment about the specific tickets in the specific modules that are used. For example, when supporting a new datasource, we will need patches (at least) in `Perceval`, `GrimoireELK` and panels. We would open here the feature request (or the user story) for the whole case, an issue (and later a pull request) in `Perceval` for the data retriever, same for `GrimoireELK` for the enriching code, and same for `panels` for the Kibiter panels.
