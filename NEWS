The following list describes the changes by component:

### kidash
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Show when tables are loading (#772)\
   The individuals and organizations tables now show a progress bar to
   indicate that the items are loading.
 * Organization profiles\
   Each organization's full profile is available by clicking its name on
   the table or at `/organization/<organization name>`. This view shows
   the organization's teams, members and domains.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Sort jobs from newest to oldest (#769)\
   The jobs page now sorts the list from newest to oldest to show running
   jobs first.
 * Unreadable large numbers in pagination (#770)\
   Large page numbers were not fully visible in the tables pagination.
 * Edit a profile name with the pencil button (#773)\
   Clicking on an invidual's name no longer activates the edition mode.
   The name can now be edited with the pencil button.
 * Fix enrollment in individual's profile\
   In the individual's profile, the button to add an organization was not
   working.
 * Job timeouts\
   Jobs failed because they exceeded the default timeout while running
   tasks involving numerous identities. To ensure successful completion,
   we adjusted the timeout setting to an infinite duration, allowing jobs
   to finish without interruptions.

**Breaking changes:**

 * Multi-tenancy using headers\
   Tenants are now selected using the `sortinghat-tenant` header instead
   of the host. Proxies and clients using multi-tenancy should include
   that header.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Performance improved for recommendations and merging jobs\
   The performance of the matching and merging algorithms that are used
   on these jobs have been considerably improved. These jobs will be 4
   times faster than on the previous version.
 * uWSGI threads and workers\
   Include two new environments variables to define the number of threads
   and workers for uWSGI. These new variables are
   `SORTINGHAT_UWSGI_WORKERS` and `SORTINGHAT_UWSGI_THREADS`
 * SortingHat database performance\
   Improve SortingHat performance when there are a lot of individuals in
   the database.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Update dependencies\
   Include google-auth as a dependency to fix release issues.

   all clients during execution.

### sirmordred

**New features:**

 * Optional configuration for SortingHat\
   Include an optional configuration for SortingHat to define the name of
   the tenant when multi-tenancy is enabled.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Race condition initializing SirMordred\
   There was a race condition when SirMordred initializes. The thread
   that read the list of projects didn't have time to even start before
   the manager finalizes it, so data backends didn't have any have any
   input to work with. This bug was originally reported by ncsibra-lab49
   on
   [grimoirelab#585](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/585).

The following list describes the changes by component:

### grimoirelab-toolkit
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### kidash
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### sortinghat

**New features:**

 * Set top domain from UI (#729)\
   Add the option to set an organization's domain as top domain from the
   UI.
 * Order individuals by indentities (#732)\
   Adds the option to order the individuals by the number of identities
   they have.
 * Import identities automatically (#746)\
   Create a schema to import identities to SortingHat automatically using
   custom backends. The jobs will be executed periodically, at the given
   interval.  The tasks can be configured using the GraphQL API.  To
   create a custom importer you need to extend `IdentitiesImporter`,
   define a `NAME` for your importer (that will be used in the UI), and
   implement `get_identities` method that returns a list of individuals
   with the related identities that will be imported into SortingHat. If
   your importer requires extra parameters, you must extend the
   `__init__` method with the required parameters. Those parameters can
   be defined using the API.
 * Create account command\
   Include a new command to create users in SortingHat. The command can
   be executed as `sortinghat-admin create-user`.
 * Drag and drop to enroll in teams\
   Expanding an organization on the table now shows the full list of
   teams. Individuals can be dragged and dropped into a team and
   viceversa to affiliate them. The buttons to add, edit and delete
   organization and team information are reorganized into a dropdown menu
   to simplify the interface.
 * Multi-tenancy mode\
   SortingHat allows hosting multiple instances with a single service
   having each instance's data isolated in different databases. To enable
   this feature follow these guidelines: - Set `MULTI_TENANT` settings to
   `True`. - Define the tenants in `sortinghat/config/tenants.json`. -
   Assign users to tenants with `sortinghat-admin set-user-tenant`
   command.
 * Verify SSL option for client\
   Include an option for the client to verify if the certificate is
   valid. By default it is verified.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix outdated recommendation count (#733)\
   The number of remaining recommendations on the UI was wrong each time
   a recommendation was applied or dismissed.
 * Fix search syntax link (#735)\
   Fixes the link to the search syntax page on the search bar.

**Feature removals:**

 * Groups table removed from the UI\
   Groups and organizations are very similar, and having both tables in
   the dashboard can be confusing to users. To simplify the view, the
   table is removed from the user interface, but groups remain available
   through the API.

### cereslib

**New features:**

 * Support for more languages and file types\
   The library is able to detect the new file formats and language
   formats. This list includes JavaScript, TypeScript, Terraform, among
   others.

### perceval

**Bug fixes:**

 * Default value for mbox to-date (#810)\
   Include a default value for `--to-date` argument in mbox backend.

### perceval-mozilla
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-opnfv
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-puppet
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### perceval-weblate
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

### graal

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Update package dependencies\
   Update package dependencies and pin `markdown-it-py` to a specific
   version.

### grimoire-elk

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix typo in SortingHat fields\
   Some fields were not updated from the old version of SortingHat. Now
   the API returns 'isBot' and 'genderAcc' instead of 'is_bot' and
   'gender_acc'.

**Breaking changes:**

 * Define date format for Git documents\
   Git by default uses a custom date format that is not recognized by
   Elastic/OpenSearch.  Specify the format for the AuthorDate and
   CommitDate fields in Git documents to support the formats usually
   returned by `git log`.  This allows us to do proper filtering on these
   fields such as "all documents with CommitDate before 2020".
 * Update support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X\
   Currently the support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X is broken due to a
   faulty version check.  Add a static method to the Elasticsearch object
   that correctly checks whether the version is 'legacy' (defined as ES
   6.X or OS 0.X) and adds this check to various places in the codebase.
   Additionally, fixes an instance where `interval` is used instead of
   `fixed_interval`. `interval` was deprecated in ES7.

### sirmordred

**New features:**

 * SirMordred logs available on console\
   All SirMordred logs are now available on the console output. The
   `logs_dir` parameter in the `general` section is optional and it is
   only needed if you also want the logs in a file.
 * SortingHat option to verify SSL\
   Include `verify_ssl` option to SortingHat configuration to verify the
   connection with the server. By default it is `True`.

**New features:**

 * Development and reviewing contributors fields for Git items\
   New information about the participants during the development and the
   reviewing processes are available in `Git` items. The Git backend
   extracts these data from `Approved-by`, `Co-authored-by`,  and
   `Merged-by` trailers that some commit messages might include. For each
   one of these trailers, new fields will be available with the suffixes:
   `_bots`, `_domains`, `_names`, `_org_names`, and `_uuids`. Also for
   each one of these suffixes, there will be extra fields with the prefix
   `non_authored_`. This is an example of the fields available for the
   the trailer `Merged-by`:     - merged_by_multi_bots     -
   merged_by_multi_domains     - merged_by_multi_names     -
   merged_by_multi_org_names     - merged_by_multi_uuids     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_bots     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_domains     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_names     -
   non_authored_merged_by_multi_org_names
 * Option 'to-date' on the backend sections\
   The option `to-date` on the `setup.cfg` allows fetching data until a
   specific date. By default, this value is `2100-01-01`.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Onion study on Github pull requests fixed\
   Github pull requests onion study is now updated to allow passing the
   study alias name by parameter.
 * Onion study on Gitlab fixed\
   Gitlab onion study is now updated to allow passing the study alias
   name by parameter.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * New Pandas version\
   Update Pandas to the newest version compatible with Python 3.7+.

### sirmordred

**New features:**

 * New default GitHub pull requests alias names\
   GitHub pull_request category (github:pull) has its own aliases now:
   `github_pull_requests` and `github_pull_requests-raw`. This category
   used to share the default aliases for GitHub: `github` and `github-
   raw`.


## GrimoireLab 0.4.0 - (2022-06-29)

 * sirmordred 0.3.1

### Perceval

**New features:**

 * [confluence] Option `max_contents` to limit the number of requested contents\
   This parameter sets the maximum number of contents requested per
   query. By default, this number is 200, but this can be changed by
   adding the `--max-contents` argument. This will help to bypass those
   instances where the maximum limit is lower than Perceval's default
   value.

**Bug fixes:**

 * [confluence] KeyError exception when arguments not passed to 'fetch_items'\
   Required arguments that weren't passed to 'fetch_items' made the code
   fail with a KeyError exception.
 * [bugzillarest] Failback when checking custom instances\
   Some Bugzilla instances return a HTTP 400 error when checking if their
   are custom instances or not. On those cases, the backend will capture
   the error and consider the version of that Bugzilla instance as
   custom.
 * [slack] Slack identifier extraction fixed\
   Extract the identifier without user information when the user was
   deleted.

## GrimoireLab 0.3.0 - (2022-06-07)

**Feature removals:**

 * Drop Python 3.6 support\
   Python 3.6 has reached the end of life in Dec 2021. This means it
   won't receive any further patches to fix the secutiry issues. So,
   dropping the support of 3.6 and it now supports Python>=3.7 version
   only.

**New components:**

 * grimoirelab-toolkit 0.3.0
 * perceval 0.18.0
 * perceval-mozilla 0.3.0

The following list describes the changes by component:

### Perceval

**New features:**

 * [bugzillarest] API Key authentication\
   A new authentication is available in the `bugzillarest` backend using
   an API Key. This can be provided using the parameter `--api-key` on
   the command line. Note that this parameter will invalidate `--backend-
   user` `--backend-password`, and `--api-token` parameters. For
   developers, this parameter is also available during the initialization
   of the class `BugzillaRESTClient` under the name `api_key`.
 * Confluence supports fetch by spaces\
   This allows fetching confluence by specific spaces. By default it will
   fetch the entire instance, but adding the `--spaces` argument will
   fetch only these spaces.

### Graal

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix error in update worktree\
   Graal wasn't working with the latest version of Git 2.35.1 because it
   protects braches checked out in all worktrees. This change renames the
   branch created when creating a worktree to fix the issue.
   
### Sorting Hat

**Bug fixes:**

 * [gitdm] Skip invalid format lines\
   Gitdm parser won't fail reading files with an invalid format. Instead,
   it will ignore invalid content.

### GrimoireELK

**New features:**

 * Anonymize parameters\
   A new API function `anonymize_params(params)` allows to anonymize a
   list of parameters that developers might consider secrets. It will
   only take effect for those parameters which their names are defined on
   `SECRET_PARAMETERS` constant.
 * Dependencies file for development\
   Include a new requirements.txt file to install the development version
   from the repositories.
 * Support to add identities to SortingHat from Enrich class\
   New methods `add_identities` and `add_identity` are available on
   `Enrich` class to add new identities to a `SortingHat` database.
   Libraries using `elk` won't need to use `sortinghat` library to store
   new identities while enriching items.
 * Collect and enrich confluence by spaces\
   Users can collect and enrich Confluence data from specific spaces
   only, adding the option `--spaces=[SPACE1, SPACE2, ...]` to their
   `projects.json`. The following example shows how to collect and to
   enrich data from only the `DEV` and `SUPP` spaces only. ``` {
   "project": {         "confluence": [             "http://example.com
   --spaces=[DEV, SUPP]"         ]     } } ```
 * Add demographic study to mattermost\
   Add the demographic study to the mattermost data source.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Skip sources with wrong arguments\
   Sources won't interrupt collection or enrichment processes when any of
   their arguments are invalid. Instead, they will be skipped.
 * Git fix 'is_git_commit_multi_author'\
   This fixes the `is_git_commit_multi_author` field when the commit has
   more than one author and `pair-programming` is enabled. This is
   important for calculating `pair_programming_*` values.
 * SortingHat as a required package\
   SortingHat is required for running grimoireelk but it was set as an
   extra dependency. From now on sortinghat is always installed with
   grimoireelk.
 * Confluence credentials not stored in raw indexes\
   Credentials for Confluence datasource were stored in raw indices as
   part of the URL. For now on, credentials that are part of URLs are
   removed before any data is stored.
 * Pair programming regular expression improvement\
   The regular expression to detect pair programming authors in git
   datasource has been improved adding more connectors. The following
   list shows the current connectors: - `[aA][nN][dD]` - `&` - `+`
 * Fix fetching authors with min and max dates\
   The old query only returns 10000 items due to ElasticSearch and
   OpenSearch now use `composite` aggregation to paginate all buckets.

### Sir Mordred

**New features:**

 * Add extract spaces\
   Extract spaces from the URL. By default it will extract labels but
   adding `tag_type="spaces"` it will extract spaces.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Studies aliases relocated\
   Relocate studies aliases so they are not created automatically by
   Mordred.
 * Add pair-programming in '_get_enrich_backend' method\
   Add the `pair-programming` to the `_get_enrich_backend` method if it
   exists in the setup.cfg file.

**Feature removals:**

 * FINOS Meeting backend removed\
   FINOS Meeting backend is not supported anymore. The Perceval backend
   was archived in Bitergia repository so it shouldn't be part of the
   core anymore because it's software not maintained.

**Others:**

 * Add studies to the alias file\
   Add onion, areas of code, and demographics studies to the file
   aliases.json. This is needed to keep this file updated with the
   aliases we use in the dashboards by adding them to the appropiate data
   sources. The included aliases: - all_onion - git_areas_of_code -
   demographics
