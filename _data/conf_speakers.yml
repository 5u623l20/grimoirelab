  title: Open Source Metrics to Inform Corporate Strategy
  description: <p>Any company that relies on open source software as a critical component of their products and services should want to understand the strategic value of the project and community; doing so ensures the company is best leveraging the benefits that open source technology can bring. With GrimoireLab, it's now much easier to compile valuable information that can be used to better understand the strategic value of specific open source projects.</p><p>This talk will use quantitative metrics generated with GrimoireLab to evaluate the strategic value of open source projects and their communities, and it will cover how we're planning to use this information to inform Samsung's overall strategy. How effective are internal open source engineering teams at getting code upstream? Does the community incorporate new features and fix bugs and security flaws adequately to meet the needs of the company? What companies and organizations exert the most influence over the community? Is the overall health of the community adequate to meet the needs of the company? How diverse is the developer ecosystem and are there ideal candidates for hire? We're seeking to answer these questions and more.</p>

  title: How Metrics Helps Change Cultural Dynamics of Diversity
  description: <p>Without measuring current state and progress, we are blind and lose accountability. Metrics in diversity has helped us create awareness, hold organizations accountable and provide an objective data driven way to create change. Companies started releasing their diversity metrics in 2014 and it has created a dialogue around what to measure and how to create change. She will talk about our collaboration with Bitergia to create diversity metrics to drive change in Open Stack, Linux Kernel and Apache.</p>
